# About

Wani Reference is an app that allows you to browse and view the various Kanji available in WaniKani. 

WaniKani is a website that utilizes a technique called Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to teach students Japanese Kanji and Vocab. 

Wani Reference aims to bring a more native mobile feel to what is a web based application as a supplement to users of WaniKani. It also gives you the ability to set a widget that will update with a random “Kanji of the Day” so you can see something new every day on your homescreen.
